# Basic puissance-4 simulation

## Getting started

To launch the game on local computer

A live demo is availalble on [gh-pages](https://xavierjp.github.io/puissance-4/)


## Todo

- Style is still a draft

- Code misses comments

- Players could choose board game dimension (other than 10x10)

- An IA would be great

- Add possibility to be more than two players
